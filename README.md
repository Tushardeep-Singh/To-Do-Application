## Learning Journey

I developed this mini-project while learning React. Throughout this process, I have become familiar with the core concepts of React and have gained hands-on experience in building a functional web application. Although I am not yet an expert developer, I am continuously learning and improving my skills.  
  
I have a strong ability to understand documentation, which allows me to continuously improve my skills.

## Internship Opportunity

I am actively seeking a 6-month internship where I can further develop my skills and gain professional experience. While I may not always remember every detail during an interview, I am committed to learning. I am eager for the opportunity to contribute to a team, receive guidance, and grow as a developer.
